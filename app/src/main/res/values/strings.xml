    <string name="about_text3">This applications was created for learning purposes while studying in
        VIA University College, Mobile applications 1 course. It has basic functionality.
        You can use it to send emails, or browse in the internet. To make it more customizable there is
        an option to change the color of buttons and it will be saved in preferences. That means the
    next time you will open this app the colors will be as the last time you left them. If you are
    still reading this, that means I have no idea what to write more so that there would be more
    text here. Have a nice day!</string>
